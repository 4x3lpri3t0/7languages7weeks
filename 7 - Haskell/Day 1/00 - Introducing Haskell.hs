--Haskell represents purity and freedom for many functional programming purists.

--Where Scala, Erlang, and Clojure let you use imperative concepts in small doses, Haskell leaves no such wiggle room.
--This pure functional language will challenge you when itâ€™s time to do I/O or accumulate state.

--INTRODUCING HASKELL

--A group from the Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture conference in 1987
--formed and decided to build an open standard for a pure functional language.

--Haskell was born in 1990 and revised again in 1998.

--Haskell was built from the ground up to be a pure functional language, combining ideas from
--the best functional languages, with special emphasis on lazy processing.

--Haskell has strong, static typing, like Scala.

--The type model is mostly inferred and is widely considered to be one of
--the most effective type systems of any functional language.
