// CONCURRENCY

// The primary constructs are actors and message passing.

// Actors have pools of threads and queues.

// When you send a message to an actor (using the ! operator),
// you place an object on its queue.

// The actor reads the message and takes action.

// Often, the actor uses a pattern matcher to detect the
// message and perform the appropriate message.

// Kid is an actor, meaning it will run from a pool of threads
// and get messages in a queue.

// It will process each message and move on to the next.

// We start a simple loop.

// Within that is a react construct.

// react receives an actorâ€™s messages.

// The pattern match lets us match the appropriate message,
// which will always be Poke or Feed.
