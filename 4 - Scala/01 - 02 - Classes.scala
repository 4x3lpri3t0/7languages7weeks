// AUXILIARY CONSTRUCTORS

// class with two constructors:

class Person(first_name: String) {
	println("Outer constructor")
	def this(first_name: String, last_name: String) {
		this(first_name)
		println("Inner constructor")
	}

// ----

// EXTENDING CLASSES

// Companion Objects and Class Methods

// When there's something that can have only one instance,
// youâ€™ll define it with the object keyword instead of the class keyword:

object TrueRing {
	def rule = println("To rule them all")
}

TrueRing.rule

// The TrueRing definition works exactly like any class definition (static),
// but it creates a singleton object.

// In Scala, you can have both an object definition and a class
// definition with the same name.

// Using this scenario, you can create class methods
// within the singleton object declaration and instance methods
// within the class declaration.

// In our example, the method rule is a class method.
// This strategy is called companion objects.
