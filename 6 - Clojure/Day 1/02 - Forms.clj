; FORMS

; Think of a form as a piece of syntax. When Clojure parses code, it
; first breaks the program down into pieces called forms. Then, Clojure
; can compile or interpret the code.

; Code and data, in Lisp, they are one and the same.

; Booleans, characters, strings, sets, maps, and vectors are
; all examples of forms.
